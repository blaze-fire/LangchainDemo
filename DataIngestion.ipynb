       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.

We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

It is compatible with any LLM Application and provides seamless integration with LangChain, a widely recognized open-source framework that simplifies the process for developers to create powerful language model applications.\\n\\nNote: You can enjoy the benefits of LangSmith without using the LangChain open-source packages! To get started with your own proprietary framework, set up your account and then skip to Logging Traces Outside LangChain.\\n\\n\\nCookbook: For tutorials on how to get more value out of LangSmith, check out the Langsmith Cookbook repo.\\n\\nA typical workflow looks like:\\n\\nSet up an account with LangSmith.\\nLog traces.\\nDebug, Create Datasets, and Evaluate Runs.\\n\\nWe\\'ll walk through these steps in more detail below.\\n1. Connect to LangSmith\\nSign up for LangSmith using your GitHub, Discord accounts, or an email address and password. If you sign up with an email, make sure to verify your email address before logging in.\\nThen, create a unique API key on the Settings Page.\\nNote: Save the API Key in a secure location. It will not be shown again.\\n2. Log Traces\\nYou can log traces natively in your LangChain application or using a LangSmith RunTree.\\nLogging Traces with LangChain\\nLangSmith seamlessly integrates with the JavaScript LangChain library to record traces from your LLM applications.\\nyarn add langchain\\n\\nCopy the environment variables from the Settings Page and add them to your application.\\n\\nTracing can be activated by setting the following environment variables or by manually specifying the LangChainTracer.\\nprocess.env[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\";\\nprocess.env[\"LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT\"] = \"https://api.smith.langchain.com\";\\n// process.env[\"LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT\"] = \"https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com\"; // If signed up in the EU region\\nprocess.env[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = \"<YOUR-LANGSMITH-API-KEY>\";\\n// process.env[\"LANGCHAIN_PROJECT\"] = \"My Project Name\"; // Optional: \"default\" is used if not set\\n\\nTip: Projects are groups of traces. All runs are logged to a project. If not specified, the project is set to default.\\n\\n\\nRun an Agent, Chain, or Language Model in LangChain\\n\\nIf the environment variables are correctly set, your application will automatically connect to the LangSmith platform.\\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from \"langchain/chat_models/openai\";\\n\\nconst chat = new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0 });\\nconst response = await chat.predict(\\n  \"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\"\\n);\\nconsole.log(response);\\nLogging Traces Outside LangChain\\nYou can still use the LangSmith development platform without depending on any\\nLangChain code. You can connect either by setting the appropriate environment variables,\\nor by directly specifying the connection information in the RunTree.\\n\\nCopy the environment variables from the Settings Page and add them to your application.\\n\\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<YOUR-LANGSMITH-API-KEY>\\n# export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=\"My Project Name\" #  Optional: \"default\" is used if not set\\n# export LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com # or your own server\\nIntegrations\\nLangsmith\\'s traceable wrapper function makes it easy to trace any function or LLM call in your own favorite framework. Below are some examples.\\nOpenAI SDK\\nThe easiest way to trace calls from the OpenAI SDK with LangSmith\\nis using the wrapOpenAI wrapper function available in LangSmith 0.1.3 and up.\\nIn order to use, you first need to set your LangSmith API key:\\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\\nNext, you will need to install the LangSmith SDK and the OpenAI SDK:\\nnpm install langsmith openai\\nAfter that, initialize your OpenAI client and wrap the client with wrapOpenAI method to enable tracing for the completions and chat completions methods:\\nimport { OpenAI } from \"openai\";\\nimport { wrapOpenAI } from \"langsmith/wrappers\";\\n\\nconst openai = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());\\n\\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({\\n  model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\\n  messages: [{ content: \"Hi there!\", role: \"user\" }],\\n});\\nAlternatively, you can use the traceable function to wrap the client methods you want to use:\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\n\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst createCompletion = traceable(\\n  openai.chat.completions.create.bind(openai.chat.completions),\\n  { name: \"OpenAI Chat Completion\", run_type: \"llm\" }\\n);\\n\\nawait createCompletion({\\n  model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\\n  messages: [{ content: \"Hi there!\", role: \"user\" }],\\n});\\nNote the use of .bind to preserve the function\\'s context. The run_type field in the\\nextra config object marks the function as an LLM call, and enables token usage tracking\\nfor OpenAI.\\nOftentimes, you use the OpenAI client inside of other functions or as part of a longer\\nsequence. You can automatically get nested traces by using this wrapped method\\nwithin other functions wrapped with traceable.\\nconst nestedTrace = traceable(async (text: string) => {\\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\\n    messages: [{ content: text, role: \"user\" }],\\n  });\\n  return completion;\\n});\\n\\nawait nestedTrace(\"Why is the sky blue?\");\\n{\\n  \"id\": \"chatcmpl-8sPToJQLLVepJvyeTfzZMOMVIKjMo\",\\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\\n  \"created\": 1707978348,\\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\\n  \"choices\": [\\n    {\\n      \"index\": 0,\\n      \"message\": {\\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n        \"content\": \"The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering.

The Mistral client responses are\\n  // compatible with the Vercel AI SDK OpenAIStream adapter.\\n  const stream = OpenAIStream(response as any);\\n\\n  // Respond with the stream\\n  return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);\\n}\\nSee the AI SDK docs for more examples.\\nArbitrary SDKs\\nYou can use the generic wrapSDK method to add tracing for arbitrary SDKs.\\nDo note that this will trace ALL methods in the SDK, not just chat completion endpoints.\\nIf the SDK you are wrapping has other methods, we recommend using it for only LLM calls.\\nHere\\'s an example using the Anthropic SDK:\\nimport { wrapSDK } from \"langsmith/wrappers\";\\nimport { Anthropic } from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk\";\\n\\nconst originalSDK = new Anthropic();\\nconst sdkWithTracing = wrapSDK(originalSDK);\\n\\nconst response = await sdkWithTracing.messages.create({\\n  messages: [\\n    {\\n      role: \"user\",\\n      content: `What is 1 + 1? Respond only with \"2\" and nothing else.`,\\n    },\\n  ],\\n  model: \"claude-3-sonnet-20240229\",\\n  max_tokens: 1024,\\n});\\n:::tip\\nClick here to see an example LangSmith trace of the above.\\n:::\\nAlternatives: Log traces using a RunTree.\\n\\nA RunTree tracks your application.
